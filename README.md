# Assignment5_Ride-Sharing-System (C++ & Smalltalk)

This repository contains a dual-language implementation of a Ride Sharing System developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The system is implemented in both **C++** and **Smalltalk** to demonstrate how core OOP concepts can be applied across different paradigms.

## Whatâ€™s Included

- `C++/`: A statically-typed version using virtual functions and class hierarchies.
- `Smalltalk/`: A dynamically-typed version implemented in Pharo 12 with class protocols and message passing.

Each version includes its own source files, documentation, and test examples.

## OOP Principles Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation**: Internal state is accessed only through well-defined interfaces.
- **Inheritance**: Common behavior is shared through base and derived classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Overridden methods behave differently depending on the ride type.

## How to Explore

Refer to the respective README files in each folder for build instructions and usage:

- [C++ README](./C++/README.md)
- [Smalltalk README](./smalltalk/README.md)
